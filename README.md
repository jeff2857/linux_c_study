This repository includes exercises and demos I coded when I learn Linux/UNIX system programming.

Books I'm reading recently are:
- Beginning Linux Programming
- The Linux Programming Interface - A Linux and UNIX System Programming Handbook
- Pointers On C

Hope it won't take too long to finish reading these books.
Keep coding... :)
